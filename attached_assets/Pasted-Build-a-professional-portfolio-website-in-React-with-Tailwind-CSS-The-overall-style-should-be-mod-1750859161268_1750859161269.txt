Build a professional portfolio website in React with Tailwind CSS. The overall style should be **modern and minimalist**: use a clean, uncluttered layout with a white or light-gray background, plenty of whitespace, and one bold accent color for buttons and links. The site must be fully **responsive (mobile-first)**, with readable typography and intuitive navigation.

Include these sections:

1. **About (Education & Experience):**  
   - Header with my name, photo, and a brief intro (education, skills, experience, background).

2. **Projects Gallery:**  
   - Grid of project cards with thumbnail images.  
   - Under each image, three elements:  
     - Link/button to **live demo** or deployed site.  
     - Link/button to **GitHub repo**.  
     - Button to open **project documentation** (PDF or external link).  
   - **Interactive ML/DL Demos:**  
     - For any trained model (e.g., ResNet image classifier, Transformer text generator), embed a small UI widget where visitors can upload an example or type text and see model output in real-time.  
     - **Model training code and raw artifacts** live in a **private GitHub repo** or cloud drive; only the compiled frontend (UI) is published to GitHub Pages.

3. **Certificates & Trainings:**  
   - Grid of certificate/training images or logos.  
   - If there’s an online verification link, make the image clickable to verify; otherwise just show the image preview.

4. **Volunteer & Community:**  
   - Showcase any volunteer work, open-source contributions, or community projects.

5. **Blog:**  
   - A blog section styled like Medium: list of posts with title, date, short excerpt, and “Read More” links.  
   - Manage posts via markdown files or a simple headless CMS—no need to redeploy for each new post.  
   - **Raw `.md` files** remain private; only the generated HTML is served.

6. **Contact:**  
   - Functional contact form (e.g., via Formspree or EmailJS).  
   - Social icons linking to LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc.

**Extra Requirements & Features:**  
- All **source code** for interactive demos, model training scripts, and raw blog posts must reside in a **single private repo**.  
- Include a **GitHub Actions** workflow that on every push builds the React/Tailwind site (`npm ci && npm run build`) and deploys **only** the `build/` folder to the **gh-pages** branch.  
- Configure GitHub Pages to serve from the **gh-pages** branch, so only the static frontend appears at `https://username.github.io/`.  
- Subtle UI polish: smooth hover animations on buttons/links, soft shadows, rounded corners.  
- Sticky navbar and a “back to top” button.  
- Dark-mode toggle.  
- Scroll-triggered animations (e.g., Framer Motion).  
- SEO metadata and Open Graph tags for social sharing.  
- Must be optimized for fast loading and deployable as a **static site** on GitHub Pages.

Generate this site with placeholder content and images—I'll swap in my real data later.```
