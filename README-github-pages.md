git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to **Pages** section
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. The deployment will start automatically

### 3. Build and Deploy Locally (Optional)

# The built files will be in the 'docs' folder
# You can also deploy manually using:
